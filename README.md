🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: House Price Prediction 🏡
I’m thrilled to announce the completion of Task1 by Bharat Intern on predicting house prices! 🎉
🔍 Project Overview: I built a House Price Prediction model that takes into account key factors like:
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Area in square feet
Zip code of the desired location
The model was trained on a cleaned dataset and deployed using Flask, allowing users to input their preferences and get an estimated price for the house they want.
💡 Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the dataset to ensure accurate predictions.
Machine Learning: Utilized regression models to predict house prices based on user inputs.
Deployment: The application is live and running, thanks to Flask!
